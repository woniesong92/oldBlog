Today was more dynamic than usual.

We started a new sprint today and decided that we would do stocks later and concentrate on tightening up some loose ends. Besides work, I had a conversation with Michael not about Hello Money but more about my career path. I also met Keith, who was passionate enough to decide against a comfortable life as a software engineer and became an entrepreneur himself. There are a lot that I want to talk about but I am falling asleep as I am typing. As soon as I wake up in a few hours, I will start refactoring Instant Music to really release next version this time.
